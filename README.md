# Vorticity-Driven Circulation 🌀🌊
Welcome! 

This directory contains code and data for investigating the contribution from vorticity fluxes to the circulation in the Lofoten basin in numerical simulations. 

We work with output from two different model simulations. Both simulations are based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), but have different resolutions. The simulations are:
- Arctic4 : ~4 km horizontal resolution, 30 vertical layers.
- Lofoten800 : ~800 m horizontal resolution, 62 vertical layers.

### Notebooks
Work in progress is presented in the following notebooks:
- **Present_1.ipynb**: rms values, direct time integrals, linear model (integrating factor) results.   
- **Present_2.ipynb**: Adjusted friction coefficients, time integrals with parametrized friction.
